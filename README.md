Prism Silex Skeleton
====================

A [Silex][1] skeleton application for [Prism][2].

Prism is a URL Shortener and Custom Header Injector. This project is intended
to be used as a barebones base application.

The goal of this skeleton is to provide minimal boilerplate such that keeping
an instance of Prism up to date can be done via `composer update` and requiring
little to no tweaking of the already existing boilerplate.

Through [Composer][3] as [offloc/prism-silex-skeleton][4].
